<h3 align="center">CS Grad | Full-Stack Developer (in progress) | App Builder | Tech Explorer</h3>

I'm a **Computer Science graduate** with a passion for turning ideas into real, working software. Whether it's helping students manage money with an Android app or building a tool to keep fans up-to-date with game days — I'm always building.

Currently diving deep into **full-stack development** — strengthening my backend skills, learning **React** on the frontend, and aiming to create tools that are both **useful and cleanly designed**.

### 🛠️ Tech I Work With

- **Languages:** Kotlin, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python  
- **Mobile:** Jetpack Compose, Android XML

### ✨ Fun Facts

- I’m a night owl developer 🦉 — most of my code is born after midnight.
- My apps are usually built for a real-world purpose (and often for friends who say, *“Hey, can you make an app for that?”*).
- One of my favourite things is refactoring code that looks like it’s been through a blender.
